# million dollar idea

Make markment automatically look for docstrings in python modules,
classes, methods and functions.

Then it will parse the strings as markdown, use pygments to apply the
syntax hightlighting, and generate a full static website with the API
documentation just like doxygen does for C++.

This is inspired in QT's documentation

After creating code climate for python, integrate markment's auto
documentation generator with it, so the code climate python customers
will get their api documentation hosted for free.
