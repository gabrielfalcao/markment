Ever wanted to generate beautiful documentation for your project, github is great for it, supports markdown and generates pages for you. They even have a handful of themes you can choose from. And everything is just a few clicks away.

But you are a hacker and you are really excited about your new
project, and your documentation is bigger than just a README file. And
you want to choose other themes than the ones that github provide, or
even just use their themes but among all your markdown files.

Markment is here for you.

Markment is a tool for generating beautiful documentation for projects
that use markdown. Markment is actually a set of tools but you don't
need to use them separately, unless you want.

Markment is composed of:

* A command line tool for generating static documentation pages

* A builtin server so you can preview your documentation.

* An API for parsing and generating beautiful html from markdown with github-like syntax highlighting and a clever way to render relative links.
